Module 5 challenge
Capomulin and Remican both showed promising and somewhat similar results
Capomulin is a viable drug regimen to reduce tumor growth (taken from Steven Greene/Instructor's result)
Larger mice by weight have larger tumor volume - correlated - possible that larger mice are more receptive to the treatment
One mouse in the Infubinol study showed decrease in tumor volume while others showed increase. This could have been spontaneous, but merits further study.
